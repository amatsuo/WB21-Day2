## Day 2

We are going to use the covid 19 dataset along with the other two datasets (in "data/" folder). 

- JHU dataset
- Country level demographic data
- Presidential voting in 2016
 (or you can use, Presidential voting in 2020)

All datasets are coming from Kaggle.

- https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/covid19-us-county-jhu-data-demographics
- https://www.kaggle.com/stevepalley/2016uspresidentialvotebycounty
- https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data
- https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/us-election-2020
  - (for this one, I added fips to the original file and remove quite a bit of rows)


The task is

1. check the data completeness (e.g. make sure that all datasets have common list of counties)
2. merge the datasets
3. check whether there are any relations between covid and any demographic/political indexes

## Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read three data files

```{r}
data_covid <- read_csv("../data/covid_us_county.csv.gz", guess_max = 1e5)
data_demo <- read_csv("../data/acs2017_county_data.csv")
data_pres <- read_csv("../data/pres16results.csv")
```


## Check the validity of the data

### How the data look like


```{r}
```

- renaming is necessary for `data_demo`
- need to remove uncessary entries in fips of `data_pres`


```{r}

```



### How many rows in each df?

```{r}
nrow(data_covid)
nrow(data_demo)
nrow(data_pres)
```

### Number of counties in each data frame

- Which variable would you use to check?
- How many unique counties in each data set?
- Do they match? (if not does this seem problematic)?
    
```{r}

```

## Keep the necessary data

### Get the latest numbers cases

- From covid dataset, get the latest figures for each county

```{r}

```


### Extract trump votes

presidential votes
  - Keep only trump vote rows

```{r}

```

## Merge the datasets


### Merging

- Now lets merge the data set
  1. latest covid data
  2. country demographics
  3. presidential votes
- what `_join`?

```{r}
data_merged <- NULL

```

### Create variables for deaths/cases per 1000 population

```{r}

```

## Using the merged datasets 

- Get a correlation matrix or plot for the data
- `cor()`
- `pairs()`
- `GGally::ggpairs()`, correlation plot (I showed in day 4 lecture)
- let's check: deaths_per1000, cases_per1000, Hispanic, Black, IncomePerCap, Unemployment

```{r}


```

## Create a database

From the three datasets, let's create a database

What we need to do is:

1. Remove some duplicated fiels
2. Create a database connection using `DBI` and `RSQlite`
3. Create tables from these datasets (using `dbWriteTable()`)
4. Disconnect from the db

### check the database fields

- Remove duplicate rows
- Convert dates to character


```{r}

```


### Create database connection

```{r}
library(DBI)
file.remove("~/covid.sqlite")
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "~/covid.sqlite")

```

### Create/populate tables
```{r}

```

### Disconnect

```{r}

```
